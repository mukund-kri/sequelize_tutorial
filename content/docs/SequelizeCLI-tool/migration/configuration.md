# Configuration

Sequelize provides a lot of configuration options. But, we don't have to worry about most of them, Sequelize provides sensible defaults.

One configuration that Sequelize can't possibly know is the database connection.

In this section we'll do just that. Point Sequelize to the database.

### In this section we will ...
1. Configure the databases

## config/config.json

The main configuration file for Sequelize is `config/config.json`. In here we are going to tell Sequelize which database to connect to.

Typically we list three databases here: `development`, `test` and `production`. The `development` database is used for development. The `test` database is used for testing. The `production` database is used for production. The `config/config.json` file generated by `sequelize-cli` looks like this:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_production",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

## Step 1: Configure the database

In our case we use sqlite for development and testing. So, we need to change the `config/config.json` file to look like this:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "dialect": "sqlite",
    "storage": "./db.development.sqlite"
  }
}
```

We'll leave the `test` and 000000000`production` databases blank for now.
